# Spotify New Music Browser Server

This Express app provides backend services for my 'new music browser' React app. It uses Spotify API calls to seed an SQL database with information about the week's new releases, which is used by the front end to allow the user to sort the new releases by genre.

I have the database updating automated through pipedream.
